How to get no name:
Step 1: Copy the Javascript code that I included in the github repository, (Copy this.js) 
and go to https://studio.youtube.com ----> Customization ----> Basic Info
Step 2: Press CTRL + SHIFT + J to open the console (Windows)
Or if you are a MAC user. press CMD + OPT + J
Step 3: Paste the Javascript code into the console (dont press enter yet.)
Step 4: Go back to Studio and change your channel name to "noname" (dont press publish yet)
Step 5: Go back to the console and press enter to inject the code.
Step 6: Press the "Publish" button, and now you will have a 0char name.
